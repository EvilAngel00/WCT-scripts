How to run the competition announcement script:

- install python 2.7
- install the requests package
- run script with "python ./comps.py"
- if there are no errors, there should be a new file
  in the same folder called 'yyyy-mm-dd Competitions.txt'
  with 'yyy-mm-dd' being today's date

In the new file, the first line is the title of the post, the rest
is the content of the post.
